 # Uninsured Rates and Physical Inactivity: A Comparative Regional Study (SAS)

# Overview
This project analyzes county-level health measures across all 50 U.S. states to evaluate how uninsured rates relate to physical inactivity, including regional comparisons and multivariable modeling.

# Data
- County-level health measures dataset (academic course dataset)

# Methods
- Simple linear regression: physical inactivity ~ uninsured rate
- Diagnostics and model refinement
- Regional comparisons using ANOVA/ANCOVA
- Multivariable/stepwise modeling and interaction testing

# Key Results 
- The uninsured–inactivity association was weak in the simple model.
- Stronger predictors emerged in multivariable models, and regional differences were large.
